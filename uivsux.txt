User interface (UI)  is something that use to interact with a device on screens and pages such as buttons and icons.

User experience (UX) is something that is the internal experience that a person has as they interact with every aspect of a 
company products and sevices.

the differences is that the UI(User Interface) focused how the surface of the products looks and how it works, such as a search buttons and logos and graph, 
and UX(User Experience) focus on about how to solve a problem both positive and negative, both on-screen and off.

For example on facebook that ui is like a logo, text and looks on the page, but when you click on something link there or search something on facebook search
you will find something like stranger profile, groups, events and facebook pages under two seconds, and also when u comment something 
and click send, and that's how ux works.
